Hello! I'm Eric, one of the newest members of the FADE team. I'm from Santa Barbara, California and currently live in Boulder. I recently graduated from the University of Colorado Boulder with a degree in Aerospace Engineering. I am a member of the Colorado Air Force National Guard. Outside of work I like to ski, mountain bike, golf, and perform mediocrely at brewery trivia.
