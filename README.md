Hello! I am Eric Cervantes, one of the newest members of the FADE team. Prior to joining CACI BITS I was a student at the University of Colorado Boulder studying Aerospace Engineering. I am a member of the Colorado Air Force National Guard and the 138th Space Control Squadron. Outside of work I like to Ski, Mountain Bike, Golf, and binge watch Netflix.
